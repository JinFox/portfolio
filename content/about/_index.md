I am a passionated game developer currently opened to job opportunities.
Curious by nature, I have interests in many topics: 
- Game development (especially client and UI/UX)
- Technical arts
- Procedural Generation
- Artificial Intelligence (Genetic algorithm, Neural Networks).

Well versed in Unity development with C# and also with WPF (UI framework), I have made of my speciality the implementation of UI architecture.
I have several years of programming behind me and a master degree in Computing Sciences.
