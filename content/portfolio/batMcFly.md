Bat McFly was a personal project that I tried to put in place in order to challenge myself into implementing a known mechanic (flappy bird style) and to try and understand the underlying principles and the game feel of it.

My goal when developing this game on my own was to make a game from scratch, and try to approach every aspect of it:
- Make the music, the SFX.
- All visual assets.
- Programming the game logic and tweak as much as possible the game feel for it to feel 'right'.

Technically speaking, the game was just a clone of Flappy bird and was just an excuse to try and touch some aspect of art and music asset creation.
