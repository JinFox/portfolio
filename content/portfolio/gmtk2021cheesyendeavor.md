This game was made during the GMTK game jam 2021 under the theme "*Joined together*".
<!--more-->

In this game you have to play 2 mice at the same time (using WASD and arrow keys) To solve 7 different levels and get them reunited.
I used this game jam as an opportunity to try to get a smooth and polish experience with a split screen. There is still some improvement to be done for a smoother result but the whole game ended up as this cute and "relaxing" puzzle-platformer experience.
